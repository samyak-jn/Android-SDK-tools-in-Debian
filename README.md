#Android SDK Tools in Debian
-----------

##Description of the project: 
The` Android platform` is free software, including the tools used for developing apps for Android. 
Debian-derivatives are already a preferred platform for Android developers, and stretch already includes the core Android SDK tools, enough to build some apps. 
The `Debian Android Tools` team is working towards the goal of having the `entire Android toolchain` and SDK in Debian. 
That means Android apps can be developed using only free software from easy-to-use packages. In combination with Replicant, this will make the most popular operating system in the world, Android, into a 100% Free Software platform. This project is in `conjunction` with the `Debian Java team`, since many tools like gradle are for any Java software.

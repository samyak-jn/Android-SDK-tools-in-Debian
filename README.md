Android SDK Tools in Debian
-----------

Description of the project: 

The` Android platform` is free software, including the tools used for developing apps for Android. 
Debian-derivatives are already a preferred platform for Android developers, and stretch already includes the core Android SDK tools, enough to build some apps. 
The `Debian Android Tools` team is working towards the goal of having the `entire Android toolchain` and SDK in Debian. 
That means Android apps can be developed using only free software from easy-to-use packages. In combination with Replicant, this will make the most popular operating system in the world, Android, into a 100% Free Software platform. It provides the developer with the functionality to build an app with the help of easy-to-use packages. This project is a part of The Debian Android Tools teams which maintains almost 60 packages with conjugation to The Debian Java team.

The main objectives of the project are:

    Package kotlin and help to upload it to the Debian Archive.
    Package the latest Android Target Platform Framework and improve other sdk-tools.
